/**
 * DRB citation weave — deterministic post-processing that turns a research
 * agent's `report()` result into already-inline-cited text.
 *
 * Background: DeepResearch-Bench's FACT metric scores 0 when a report carries
 * no inline `[title](url)` citations at its claims (an end-of-document Sources
 * list does not count). At 4B scale the synthesizer mirrors the citation FORMAT
 * of its input rather than obeying an abstract "cite inline" mandate — so the
 * durable fix is to seed the format in the findings themselves. The `report()`
 * terminal tool carries a grammar-forced `sources: [{title, url}]` field (built
 * via rig's `ReportTool({ extraProperties, extraRequired })` schema seam); this
 * helper weaves that structured array into the findings string at result
 * capture, so synthesis input + annexures are already inline-cited.
 *
 * Semantics: for each {title, url} — replace every BARE occurrence of the exact
 * url with `[title](url)`, SKIPPING urls already inside a markdown link (preceded
 * by `](`) or inside parens (preceded by `(`), and STOPPING at a url boundary so
 * a shorter source url that is a prefix of a longer url in the body is not
 * corrupted; then append a trailing `Sources:` list. Sources are de-duplicated by
 * url and processed LONGEST-url-first so a shorter prefix url (`https://x.com`)
 * can't corrupt a longer occurrence (`https://x.com/page`). Pure + defensive: a
 * non-string result or an empty/absent/non-array `sources` returns `result`
 * unchanged. No new fields and no type changes on the capture seam — the result
 * stays a plain string.
