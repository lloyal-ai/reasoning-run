/**
 * Run ONE served Session end to end: provision its per-session reranker + app
 * services (its OWN reranker KV context over the shared resident weights, so
 * tenant documents never cross the reranker context), build the served `Runner`,
 * publish it on `RunnerCtx`, and run the UNCHANGED `harness(...)` over this
 * Session. `provisionAppModels` reads the corpus/web apps' static
 * `services: ['reranker']`, loads the reranker, and publishes it on `RerankerCtx`
 * in THIS scope — the scope `harness()` runs in, so `registry.enable` injects it.
 * The host `spawn`s this as the per-session child; its scope owns BOTH the
 * reranker resource (disposes on teardown) and the `RunnerCtx` binding, so N
 * sessions share no runner state and no native reranker context.
 *
 * `cfg.model.reranker` is the host's env-path residency → a `{path}` spec rig
 * uses as-is (no fetch); `projectRoot` is moot there but kept for consistency.
 * `applyServedGpuEnv(cfg)` runs FIRST so the reranker load below (rig has no
 * loadOptions passthrough) rides the same `LLOYAL_GPU` as the resident context.
 *
 * The last three params ARE the `harness(ctx, events, commands)` signature — a
 * driver forwards the `{context, uiChannel, commands}` it materialised for the host.
