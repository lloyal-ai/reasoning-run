/**
 * The served-host driver — reasoning.run's half of Placement B's fused Phase-1 box.
 *
 * Assembles `@lloyal-labs/host`'s injected `ServedHarness { materialise, run }` from
 * reasoning.run's `./runner` served factories, drives a `ModelRuntimeHost` (ONE resident
 * model → N Sessions), and exposes `serveConnection(socket)` to bind each `ws`
 * connection to a Session over binding's `wss()`. One active Session per connection.
 *
 * **Eager-channels** resolution of the ordering wrinkle: `wss()` needs the bus/commands
 * at bind time, but the host materialises them asynchronously inside `materialise`. The
 * driver owns the seam, so it creates the channels per connection (`createServedChannels`)
 * and `materialise` returns those SAME channels (looked up by `sessionId`) — the socket
 * binds once, at connect time, and the harness's events flow through the already-subscribed
 * bus.
 *
 * **Harness-free by design:** this file imports only the harness-FREE served factories
 * (`createServedContext`/`createServedChannels`) + the host + `wss`. The harness-running
 * `run` (which pulls the `harness` + its `.eta`) is INJECTED — `main.ts` supplies
 * `runServedSession`, the loopback test supplies a fake — so this file needs no esbuild and
 * stays unit-testable.
