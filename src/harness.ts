/**
 * Harness — pipeline that turns a user query into an answer.
 *
 * Two public Operations:
 *
 *   runQuery(query, ...)          — runs the planner, dispatches on intent.
 *                                    Handles passthrough internally; returns
 *                                    a research plan for callers to route
 *                                    (plan-review dialog or direct execution).
 *
 *   runResearchPlan(query, plan,..) — runs research → maybe-synth → finalize
 *                                    for an already-vetted plan. Used by the
 *                                    accept_plan path (after plan-review) and
 *                                    by the START path (synthetic 1-task plan
 *                                    bypassing the planner).
 *
 * Two structural gates encode invariants, not user-mode flags:
 *
 *   1. session.trunk gates the passthrough fast-path. Without a warm trunk
 *      there's nothing to fork from; the pipeline falls through to research
 *      transparently. This is what makes first-query START work without any
 *      special-case — START produces a research plan, falls into Stage 4.
 *
 *   2. plan.tasks.length > 1 gates synth. Synth aggregates findings across
 *      multiple agents into one argument. With a single agent there's
 *      nothing to aggregate — that agent's report IS the answer. The synth
 *      prompts also assume multi-agent framing ("findings from N parallel
 *      research agents"), so running synth on a single source produces
 *      awkward output.
