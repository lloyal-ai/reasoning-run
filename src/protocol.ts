/**
 * reasoning.run/protocol — the harness's wire vocabulary.
 *
 * Its `WorkflowEvent` union (down) + `Command` union (up) — the two halves of
 * the headless interface `harness(ctx, events, commands)` speaks — plus the
 * config *schema* a runner resolves and hands the harness. A host or surface
 * imports these to speak the protocol without depending on the UI.
 *
 * TYPES ONLY — this surface must stay `node:`-free so a browser/renderer can
 * import it (Artifact's renderer reads the plan/event types here). The config
 * *loaders* (`loadConfig`/`saveConfig`) deliberately stay runner-side in
 * `./tui-ink/config` — they touch `node:fs`, and only the in-package runner
 * (`runMain`) calls them.
